### What is Git and GitHub? ###

***Git*** is a program that will keep track of changes to your files. You use Git locally (on your computer) to manage files that make up a website or application. Git lives in the same folder - or **repository** - as your files and keeps track of file changes in that folder. 

It's great to have a Git-managed folder repository in case you ever accidentally mess up a file(s) or delete something that shouldn't be deleted. Git allows you to go back in time to retrieve a previous version - or a "**commit**" - of your files. 

A commit is simply telling Git to take a "snapshot" of the version of your files in that repository - or **repo** - as they are, at that point in time. You can then continue to change, add, or delete files/folders and then again tell Git to make another commit. 

As you develop a website or application you will make 100s, or even 1,000s of commits

***GitHub*** is the online copy of your local repo. It contains all version of your repository that you have "pushed" to it. 

GitHub allows you to collaborate with other developers. Simply stated: you can all be working on the code on your own computers and then store (push) and retrieve (pull) your local repo to and from GitHub so that everyone who does the same has the same codebase.
